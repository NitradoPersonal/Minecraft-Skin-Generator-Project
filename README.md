# Minecraft Skin Generator Project
The goal of this project is to create a web-based tool that lets you generate Minecraft skins. it will create unique skins based on a prompt and a dataset of existing skins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo is a fork of Minecraft LoRa Training Repo
> All of the code for now is done by @[Jack Bagel](https://github.com/Jack-Bagel)

# Simple Explanation 
It works by starting with random noise (like static on an old TV) and slowly refining it into a clear image that matches the text description. It does this by "learning" from a huge dataset of images and their descriptions.

# Goals
- [ ] Make a web based UI Inteface
- [ ] Improve the code
- [ ] Add Skins/Training Data
- [ ] Add Image to Skin feature
- [x] do the funny



# Why use LoRa?
LoRA models are small Stable Diffusion models that apply smaller changes to standard checkpoint models, making the file sizes smaller ( 2-500 MBs )

# Have questions?
Feel free to ask me anything on github or discord

# Want to Help?
If you’re into this kind of stuff and want to contribute, feel free! Fork the repo, make your changes, and send a pull request. I’m open to ideas and improvements

For now I mostly just need to add skins and their description,
so it would really help if You add your own skins and descriptions
